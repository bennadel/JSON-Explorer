# JSON Explorer

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel]

Started as a fun Code Kata, the **JSON Explorer** parses a JSON payload into an interactive data structure that can make large JSON payloads easier to observe and investigate. Furthermore, the JSON Explorer attempts to push the JSON payload into the `location.hash` as a Base64-encoded value such that you can copy-paste the URL to one of your teammates.
